A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines
• Before we can read the contents of the file we must
tell Python which file we are going to work with and
what we will be doing with the file
• This is done with the open() func,on
• open() returns a “file handle” - a variable used to
perform opera,ons on the file
– Kind of like “File -> Open” in a Word Pro
